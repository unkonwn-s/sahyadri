# Content Guide: Adding to Sahyadri Connect

Step-by-step instructions for adding each type of content. For the technical/developer overview of the site, see `README.md`.

**General rule for every Google Drive image or PDF referenced below:** the file must be shared as "Anyone with the link can view," and the ID you need is the long string in the sharing URL:

```
https://drive.google.com/file/d/  1j2nUEqjoW5XM_AtTaKuq_6v11D8DGyak  /view
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                    this is the file ID
```

## Newsletter post

**File:** add a new file to `_posts/`, named `YYYY-MM-DD-a-short-slug.md` (the date must match the date the post is set to; Jekyll uses the filename to derive it).

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "ASSEMBLY BY VEERARAGHAV SIR"
date: 2026-09-04
subtitle: "Bhagyashree Patil (Teacher)"
category: "September 2026"
image: ""
---

Article text in Markdown goes here.
```

- **`subtitle`** is the byline. It's split into first/last word and checked against `_profiles/` filenames to auto-link to that person's profile page — if there's no match, it links to a generic "profile not set up yet" page instead of breaking. A middle name, initial, or hyphenated surname will usually not match automatically; add `profile-link: "https://..."` to point it at the right page directly.
- **`category`** groups the post under a month heading on the Newsletter page (`/posts/`) — use `"Month YYYY"`, matching the existing convention.
- **`image`** (optional) is a Google Drive file ID for the post's thumbnail. There's also `image2`–`image5` for a small gallery, and `pinned: true` to pin the post above others in its category.
- Two authors: add `subtitle2` (and `profile-link2` if needed) the same way.

Nothing else needs updating — the Newsletter page automatically groups posts by academic year and category from what's already in `_posts/`.

---

## Activity

**File:** add a new file to `_activities/`, same filename convention as posts.

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Digital Safety Workshop"
date: 2025-09-22
subtitle: "Sayantan Sen (Founder, Digital Safety India)"
category: "Digital Safety Workshop"
image: ""
---
```

Same rules as a Newsletter post (byline auto-linking, `image`, `pinned`) — activities and posts share the same layout and page logic, just live in a separate collection and separate listing page (`/activities/`).

---

## Profile

**File:** add a new file to `_profiles/`, named `first-last.md` — lowercase, hyphenated, matching what a post's byline auto-link would generate (e.g. "Aadya Tyagi" → `aadya-tyagi.md`).

```yaml
---
layout: profile
title: "Aadya Tyagi"
subtitle: "Student (Class 12)"
date: 2026-06-29
academic-year: "2026-27"
profile-image: ""
---

Bio text in Markdown.
```

- **`subtitle`** must read `"Student (Class N)"` (any class 6–12) or a role like `"Teacher"` or `"Pre-School"` — the Profiles directory page (`/profiles/`) uses this text to sort and group entries. Anything else will still show, just without a sensible sort position.
- **`profile-image`** is optional; without one, a default placeholder photo is used.

---

## Photos album

**File:** `photos.html`. There's a template comment right above the entries in the file — copy this pattern:

```html
<figure class="photos-album-item" data-img="FILE_ID_HERE">
    <a href="GOOGLE_PHOTOS_LINK" target="_blank">
        <img src="" alt="EVENT NAME">
    </a>
    <figcaption>Event Name, DDth Month YYYY</figcaption>
</figure>
```

- `data-img` is the Google Drive file ID of the thumbnail (share settings as above).
- `href` is the actual Google Photos album link (shared separately, viewable by anyone with the link) — this is what visitors land on when they click.
- **Add the new album at the top of the list**, so it stays in newest-first order — the year/month tabs are generated automatically from the date in each `figcaption`, but the order *within* a tab follows the order the `<figure>` elements appear in the file, so newest-first placement is a manual convention, not something the code enforces.

---

## Video

**File:** `videos.html`.

```html
<figure class="videos-page-item">
    <div class="videos-page-wrapper" onclick="loadVideo(this)" data-video="YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID">
        <img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Event Name">
    </div>
    <figcaption>Event Name, DDth Month YYYY</figcaption>
</figure>
```

- `YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID` is the 11-character ID from the video's URL (`youtube.com/watch?v=`**`THIS_PART`**), used in both `data-video` and the thumbnail `src` — keep them identical.
- Like Photos, the year tabs are computed automatically from the date in the caption, but **add new entries at the top** to keep newest-first order within a year.

## Krishnamurti / Weekly Excerpts (`kfi.html`)

This page is more involved than the others: entries are grouped by year using a *manually maintained* list (unlike Videos/Photos, which compute years automatically), and there are two different entry types.

### Adding a new academic year tab

Near the top of the file:

```liquid
{% assign year_blocks = "2025" | split: "|" %}
{% assign default_active_year = "2025" %}
```

To add 2026 as a new tab, change the first line to `"2025|2026"` and update `default_active_year` to `"2026"` if the new year should be the one shown by default.

### Adding an embedded YouTube video

```html
<figure class="video-item" data-year="2025">
    <div class="video-wrapper" onclick="loadVideo(this)" data-video="YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID">
        <img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID/hqdefault.jpg" class="thumbnail" alt="Excerpt Title">
    </div>
    <figcaption class="video-caption">
        Excerpt - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID" target="_blank">Excerpt Title</a>,
        Published on - Mon DD, YYYY
    </figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Adding a document link (no video, just a linked PDF/Drive file)

```html
<figure class="video-item" data-year="2025">
    <figcaption class="video-caption">
        Excerpt - <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Excerpt Title</a>,
        Published on - Mon DD, YYYY
    </figcaption>
</figure>
```

- `data-year` must match one of the values in `year_blocks` above — this is how entries get grouped, unlike Videos/Photos' automatic date parsing.
- Add new entries at the top of their year's block for newest-first order.

---

## Ninad / Geet Gunjan (PDF archives)

**Files:** `ninad.md` or `geeth-gunjan.md`.

```liquid
<figure class="ninad-card">
  {% include pdf.html 
     thumbnail_path="/assets/Ninads/YEAR.png" 
     pdf_path="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=FILE_ID" 
     only_thumbnail=true %} 
  <figcaption class="ninad-caption-banner">Ninad YYYY-YY</figcaption>
</figure>
```

- `thumbnail_path` is a **local** image (upload a cover-page screenshot to `assets/Ninads/` or `assets/GeethGunjan/` first, then reference it here — this is the one field in this whole guide that isn't a Google Drive ID).
- `pdf_path` is a direct-download Drive link built from the file ID: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=FILE_ID`.
- `geeth-gunjan.md` currently has two cards sharing the same thumbnail image by mistake (see `README.md`'s "Known gaps" section) — if you're fixing that, this is the pattern to follow for the corrected thumbnail.

## After adding content

Nothing needs to be built or triggered manually — pushing to `master` automatically builds and deploys the site (see `README.md`'s "Deployment" section). Check the **Actions** tab on GitHub after pushing to confirm the build succeeded before assuming the change is live.
