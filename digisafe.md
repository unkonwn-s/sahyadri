## Chatting Safely (Classes 6,7)
Children play multiplayer online games, and in the course of the game, they speak, type and communicate with each other. This exposes them to strangers online.

What we did in the workshop:
In our workshop with Grade 6 & 7, we used realistic scenarios that reflect students' actual experiences online, inviting them to practice communication strategies, boundary-setting techniques, and community-building approaches in contexts that feel authentic and relevant. This approach acknowledges that healthy digital relationships require active care and commitment to flourish. 
The students practiced advanced communication skills for expressing their emotions clearly and responding constructively to challenging online situations.
Analysed how well they know the people they interact with online. Identified the types of messages that might cause a red flag feeling for someone.
Used the Feelings & Options thinking routine to analyse and respond to a situation involving a red flag feeling.
