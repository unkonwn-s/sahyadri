What we did in the workshop:
In our workshop with Grade 6 & 7, we used realistic scenarios that reflect students' actual experiences online, inviting them to practice communication strategies, boundary-setting techniques, and community-building approaches in contexts that feel authentic and relevant. This approach acknowledges that healthy digital relationships require active care and commitment to flourish. 

The students practiced advanced communication skills for expressing their emotions clearly and responding constructively to challenging online situations.
Analysed how well they know the people they interact with online. Identified the types of messages that might cause a red flag feeling for someone.
Used the Feelings & Options thinking routine to analyse and respond to a situation involving a red flag feeling.

## Screen Addiction (Classes 7 & 8)

Today’s students are growing up surrounded by digital media and technology. From social media and online games to streaming platforms and even AI, tech is part of everyday life. But it's easy to overdo it when the phone never stops pinging and the next episode plays automatically. Screen addiction in children has been recognised as a major problem.

An Overwhelming 85% of Indian parents express difficulties in managing their children's online content consumption [source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/60-per-cent-children-at-risk-of-digital-addiction-survey/articleshow/108731984.cms?from=mdr){:target="_blank"}

A study in Maharashtra found, 22% of children aged 9 to 17 reportedly spend more than 6 hours a day on screens. [source](https://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/2025/Jul/27/how-screen-addiction-reshaping-childhood){:target="_blank"}

A study in rural Pune found, 83.2% of secondary school children have excess screen time, primarily using mobile phones resulting in inadequate sleep. source
Excess screen use can contribute to aggression, restlessness, poor sleep, anxiety, and depression in children and adolescents by disrupting brain function, social-emotional development, and physical health.
 
### What we did in the workshop: 

Instead of prescribing rigid rules about "screen time," we conducted a workshop with grade 8 & 9 on the science behind screen addiction. This way students develop the agency to understand how technology is designed to diminish their well-being. The workshop prompted students to reflect on their personal experiences, identify design patterns, and develop individualized strategies that work best for them.

## Digital Footprint  (Classes 10, 11, 12)

As students transition from high school to higher education and the workforce, their online presence can have a profound impact on their future.

United States has made the submission of social media information compulsory for most visa applicants, including students and exchange visitors on F, M, and J visas, as part of enhanced security vetting.

A CareerBuilder survey found that 70% of employers use social media to screen candidates before hiring. Of those, 57% have found content that caused them to not hire a candidate.

According to a Kaplan survey, over 80% of admissions officers check applicants' social media profiles.
 
### What we did in the workshop:

We conducted a Digital Footprint workshop using age-appropriate, engaging activities, to enable students to express themselves authentically, protect their privacy, and understand the long-term impact of their digital actions.

These lessons build essential digital citizenship skills, helping students make smart, intentional choices about their digital footprints.

The aim was to help students navigate the complex relationship between who they are offline and how they present themselves online.
