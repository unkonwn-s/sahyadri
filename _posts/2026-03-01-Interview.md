This year, the students of grade 8 organised the New Year’s Eve dinner. The theme for the event was ‘vintage’ and the decor was to be minimalistic yet elegant. We also designed a range of games, including foosball, locksmith, ping-pong toss, mini bowling and flip the bottle. Teachers and students from across the batches took part in the games and enjoyed them thoroughly. As always, the food was the most eagerly awaited part of the evening, with the Dining Hall delighting everyone with the delicious Pita and Hummus, as well as the Chocolate Lava cake. 

We feel that the process of putting the New Year’s Eve dinner together helped to unite our batch. Moreover, the event proved to be a great success thanks to the help and support provided by Ria Akka, Arul Akka, Geetha Akka, Salim Sir, Purna Akka, the Didis and the Dadas. All in all, the new year began with a lasting memory of the past.
